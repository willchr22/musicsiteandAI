This a a project made for my Software Design class along with Yoni Simie and Matthew Krische
My major contribution was the cosine similarity AI recommender system.

Please ignore pretty much everything in the code relating to React, we were using a tech stack specific to the class so the website feature will no longer work and it will all be done from terminal.

MWT:
MWT is the outline of a website created for anyone who likes music, collects records, and more!
Users can keep track of their collection by using our add feature and remove things from their collection by using the remove feature. Users can also keep track of the records they may want in the future through the wishlist feature. 

VibeMatch: 
VibeMatch is a recommender system that uses Cosine Similarity to give the user a song recommendation. Based on the user's ratings of 15 songs. You will rate these songs from 0.0-5.0 and a our recommender system will provide you a recommendation.

The code is split into many different files and contains a makefile. To compile the code, make sure you are in the mwt/codeSplit/ directory and type make in the terminal. It will compile to a.out.
